- Update lint/style/format configs.

1.0.5 (2025.11.26)

- Require `btoa` in tests (polyfilled for Node) and add export coverage.
- Live test now sets `btoa` polyfill for Node environments.

1.0.4 (2025.11.26)
------------------
- Use `btoa` for basic-auth header encoding; throw when unavailable.

1.0.3 (2025.11.26)
------------------
- Make basic-auth header construction portable across Node and edge runtimes (no `node:buffer` dependency).

1.0.2 (2025.11.26)
------------------

1.0.1 (2025.11.26)
------------------
- Improve response parsing for empty/non-JSON bodies.
- `subscribe` now re-attaches unsubscribed members and surfaces required messages.
- Bulk add returns per-entry errors and 207 for partial success.
- Add Vitest unit tests and keep live test as `pnpm livetest`.
- Fix equality query encoding to avoid double-encoding.
- Preserve list memberships on `updateUser`; add UID guard requiring `forceUidChange` to overwrite existing uids.
- Live test logs subscription statuses (new, already, resubscribe) and exercises update flows.
- Adjust build script to avoid requiring pnpm when run via npm.
